Archive a Sprint
================

:points:	4
:status:	Not Started

All of the completed tasks for a sprint should be archived, along with the kanban board at the time the sprint was closed.

The archive program should accept the following parameters:

  * --status=AAAA - All tasks with status AAAA will be made part of the archive

  * --path=BBBB - The path to search for task files

  * --archive-folder=CCCC - The folder under BBBB where the archive file
    should be written.  If not present, it should default to BBBB.  If
    CCCC is a relative path, it refers to that path under each folder
    which is inspected for archiving.
