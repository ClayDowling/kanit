Status Ordering
===============

:points:	4
:status:	Not Started

Allow custom ordering of the status on the kanban board.  The ordering should
be determined by a kanit.conf file in the same folder as the tasks.  The key
"status.order" should contain a list of the stati, in the desired order.  Any
status that is outside of the list should be displayed after the listed stati.
